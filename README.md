# ML_from_Scratch
This project consists of a series of implementations of some of the most widely used and relevant machine learning algorithms, all from relative scratch.

# The Goal
The goal of this repository is to collect implementations of machine learning algorithms without the use of packages or libraries like Sklearn. 
With this in mind, this folder will contain the scripts and notebooks relevant to the implementation and usage of these functions.
The only packages used will mostly consist of Numpy and Pandas. 

Thus far, the repository contains:
- Introductory Explanation (simple data exploration)
- Mahalanobis Distance
- Expectation Maximization
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- K Nearest Neighbors (Normal, Edited, Condensed)
- ID3 Decision Tree (in-progress)
- CART Decision Tree (in-progress)

More will be added as I have time to grow this repo. 

# The Datasets
The datasets treated in this section are:
- MNIST Dataset
- Iris Dataset
- Abalone Dataset
- Forest Fires Dataset
- Congressional House Votes Dataset
- Car Maintenance Dataset
- Computer Hardware Dataset
- Breast Cancer Wisconsin 84 Dataset

Some of these will be expanded upon in the notebook entries for the decision tree and KNN implementations to come.
